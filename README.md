# Knowt-to-Quizlet-sounds
I have this very niche and first world problem where when I use Knowt (An amazing free alternative to Quizlet that does the same stuff) and i hear the sounds that it makes all i can think of is that quizlet had so much bettter sounds. So i will be attempting to make a chrome extension that changes the sounds in Knowt to the quizlet sounds.
